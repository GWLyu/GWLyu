### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ This is Zhenwei Lyu

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focusing on GW waveforms with mass transfer effects and their applications to binary evolution in astrophysics.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning superradiant instability of BHs and deep learning in GWs, etc.  
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on solving PDEs from Einstein's field equation with deep learning and any astrophysical phenomena which may have connections with GWs.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you think we could talk about.
- ğŸ“« Reach me by email: zwlyu@pku.edu.cn
