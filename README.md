## Hi there 👋 This is Zhenwei Lyu
- #### Boya Fellow at Peking University

- 🔭 I’m currently focusing on GW waveforms with mass transfer effects and their applications to binary evolution in astrophysics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning superradiant instability of BHs and deep learning in GWs, etc.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on solving PDEs from Einstein's field equation with deep learning and any astrophysical phenomena which may have connections with GWs.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you think we could talk about.
- 📫 Reach me by email: zwlyu@pku.edu.cn
